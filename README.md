In this project i used several technologies like:

1. Tailwind CSS,

3. React Router,
4. React-toatify,
5. React-spinners.
   I also use google font to style my font.

In this project there are several Apps that you can see the description of the App. You can also install those app. After installation it will show a pop-up that you already install the app . And this app will go installation section and this part you can sort by size and ratings. This section you will see which app is top-rated by ratings.
